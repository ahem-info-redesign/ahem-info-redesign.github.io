			  <h2>Bespoke Homeschooling Without Breaking the Bank</h2>
					<p>Posted February 21, 2019</p>
					<p>You’ve made the leap, cut the cord, took the plunge–however you put it--you’ve pulled your kid out of school, or made the decision not to send them at all. Often this decision means the family budget also takes a hit, as one or both parents adjust their schedules and/or work hours to spend more time with the children. It could even mean one parent leaving the workforce for a time. <a href="bespoke.html">Read more.</a></p>
					<h2>Legislative Update</h2>
					<p>Posted February 7, 2019</p>
			  <p>The Massachusetts Legislature began its 191st session on January 2, 2019. The various bills that AHEM tracked in the 190th session, regarding changes to the compulsory attendance age and other educational issues, have either died or been set aside for further study in the new session. <a href="news-archives/2019/20190207_leg_update.html">Read more. </a></p>
				<h2>Unschooling as a Feminist Act</h2>
			  <p>Posted January 3, 2019</p>
					<p>When I was a young mother, I wore a t-shirt with the words: “The hand that rocks the cradle rocks the boat.” The phrase put a spin on a 19th century poem entitled “The Hand That Rocks the Cradle Rules the World” by American poet William Ross Wallace. I understood at the time that becoming a mother was increasing my desire to create change in the world, although I didn’t know where that would lead me. I had already realized that, as the feminist movement espoused, the personal is political. I had already challenged a few assumptions about how life was supposed to work&mdash;including rejecting both the style in which I’d been parenting and the institution of school as an effective vehicle for education. <a href="unschool-feminist.html">Read more.</a></p>
